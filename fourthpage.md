# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE BASIS OF ABOVE TESTING THE CODE SNIPPETS

# PART 1: 
I don't think the code in my file could be changed in less than 10 lines for the given snippet 1 to work. The change I would suggest is longer, involved and redundant through a condition that will check for backticks and when the condition is true, then the program will run the code made for backticks. In addition I would have a extra for loop and arraylist to get the links for the program to run. 

# PART 2:
I don't think the code in my file could be changed in less than 10 lines for the given snippet 2 to work. Moreover all cases that use nested parentheses, brackets, and escape brackets due t my coding abilities and the way that I have written my code, it won't be possible to correct the program according to them. Similar to PART 1 the change I would suggest is longer, involved and redundant through a condition that will check for backticks and when the condition is true, then the program will run the code made for backticks.

# PART 3:
I don't think the code in my file could be changed in less than 10 lines for the given snippet 3 to work. Moreover all cases that use newlines, brackets, and parathesis due to my coding abilities and the way that I have written my code, it won't be possible to correct the program according to them. Similar to PART 1 ad PART 2 the change I would suggest is longer, involved and redundant through Identifying the string “https” as the start for currentIndex and to the end at a index of a new line. Again, there may be an extra for loop and ArrayList to get the same links if necessary.
